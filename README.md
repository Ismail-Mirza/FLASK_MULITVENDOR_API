# API Webserver Project

## **How To Run the Application**

- Please git clone this project
- Please add one feature and make subsequent pushes feature by feature
- After pushing the changes please make a pull request
- When making each push please mention in the README file what feature has been added and how the code needs to run
- I have created a src folder, keep all the source code of the project inside the src folder except files like README.md, .gitignore and requirements.txt
------------

The commands below install the application and its dependencies:

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt

Note for Python 3.4 users: replace `virtualenv` with `pyvenv`.

Note for Microsoft Windows users: replace the virtual environment activation command above with `venv\Scripts\activate`.

Running
-------

```
#start web server
flask run
```

# The app will run on : [localhost:5000 ](localhost:5000 "localhost:5000")
